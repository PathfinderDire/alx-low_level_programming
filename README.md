# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by Holberton School. I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](https://github.com/PathfinderDire/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)   
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](https://github.com/PathfinderDire/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while)    
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](https://github.com/PathfinderDire/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops)    
* [0x03. C - debugging](https://github.com/PathfinderDire/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging)    
* [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](https://github.com/PathfinderDire/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)  
* [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/PathfinderDire/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)    
* [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/PathfinderDire/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)    
* [0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/PathfinderDire/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)  
* More Ongoing Projects to Come..
